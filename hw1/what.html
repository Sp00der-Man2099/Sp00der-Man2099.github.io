<p>A quantum computer could run simulations with impeccable real world
    accuracy. This could be used in chemistry and medicine to find
    new solutions and cures. Thanks to entanglement it can solve complex
    algorithms using techniques not accessible to normal PCs.</p>

    <p>There is also a real possibility that someone with a quantum computer
        could be able to hack into peoples personal data by trying every combination
        until they get the password exactly. On a normal computer this could take hundreds
        or even thousands of years to guess a persons password, but on a quantum computer
        this process could be shortened, creating more problems we will need to think about.</p>
